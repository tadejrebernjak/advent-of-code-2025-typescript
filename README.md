# About
My solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025), written in Typescript

## Setup
Install dependencies
```bash
yarn
```

Build TypeScript files
```bash
yarn build
```

## Running the scripts
**Inputs are not included in the repository** - you must add them to the inputs folder for each day (e.g. 01.txt or 12.txt)

Run all days in order
```bash
node main.js all
```
Run specific days
```bash
node main.js 1 5 12
```
